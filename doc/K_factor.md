| Matches number | Rating | K |
|---|---|---|
| < 10 | All | 40 |
| 10-25 | < 1500 | 30 |
| 10-25 | >= 1500 | 25 |

This table defines how to determine the K-factor for a player in a rating system, likely for a game like padel.

What is the K-factor?

The K-factor is a crucial value that influences how much a player's rating changes after each game.
A higher K-factor means the player's rating can fluctuate more significantly with each win or loss.
How to use the table:

Determine the number of games played by the player.
Check the player's current rating.
Find the corresponding K-factor value in the table.
Example:

A player who has played 8 games (less than 10) would have a K-factor of 40, regardless of their current rating.
A player who has played 20 games (between 10 and 25) and has a rating of 1400 (less than 1500) would have a K-factor of 30.
Purpose:

New players: Higher K-factors for players with fewer games allow their ratings to adjust quickly to reflect their initial performance.
Experienced players: Lower K-factors for experienced players make their ratings more stable, reducing the impact of individual game outcomes on their overall rating.
This system aims to create a fair and balanced rating system where both rapid initial progress and long-term stability are considered.
